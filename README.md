# Sample Data

Sample data is provided for VIVO installations.

We have one sample data set.  It includes people, organizations, papers, grants, memberships, and other elements needed to demonstrate VIVO, and learn more about VIVO's approach to data representation.

In addition, we have data from [OpenVIVO](http://openvivo.org) and from [VIVO at the University of Florida](http://vivo.ufl.edu).  These are "real world" data sets.
